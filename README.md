# Data Scientist
I am an engineer with a background in power systems operations, maintenance, and data analytics. My expertise includes Microsoft Office applications, Power BI, PostgreSQL, and Python programming, with a strong passion for leveraging data-driven insights to support sustainable energy solutions.
Recently, I completed a Data Science course on DataCamp, where I worked on a capstone project applying machine learning, drawing insights from data and analytics techniques. This experience has strengthened my ability to extract insights from data and make informed decisions.
I am looking for a volunteer opportunity that allows me to apply my technical and analytical skills in energy and sustainability projects. Ideally, I would like to collaborate on initiatives involving data-driven decision-making, energy efficiency, renewable energy research, or electricity distribution, but I am open to other projects as well. I am available to contribute a minimum of 12 hours per week.
While my primary goal is to gain valuable experience and contribute meaningfully through volunteering, I appreciate any form of encouragement or recognition from those I collaborate with, whether through mentorship, learning opportunities, or gestures of appreciation

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
